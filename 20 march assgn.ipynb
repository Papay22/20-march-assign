    "Data encoding is the process of converting data from one format or representation to another. In data science, encoding is often used to convert categorical variables into numerical values that can be used in machine learning models and other data analysis techniques.\n",

    "Categorical variables are variables that take on a limited number of discrete values, such as colors, types of products, or categories of customers. These variables cannot be directly used in many machine learning algorithms, which typically require numerical inputs. Therefore, categorical variables need to be encoded into numerical values before they can be used in these algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "One common encoding technique is one-hot encoding, which creates a binary vector for each category in a categorical variable. For example, if we have a categorical variable \"color\" with three categories (red, green, and blue), one-hot encoding would create three binary vectors with a 1 in the position corresponding to the category and 0s elsewhere: 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, and 0, 0, 1.\n",

    "Nominal encoding is a type of encoding used to convert categorical variables into numerical values by assigning a unique integer to each category. This encoding is useful when the categories have no inherent order or hierarchy, and each category is equally important.\n",

We might assign 1 to Italian, 2 to Mexican, 3 to Chinese, and 4 to Indian.\n",

We can use nominal encoding to convert this categorical variable into numerical values by assigning a unique integer to each color. We might assign 1 to red, 2 to blue, 3 to green, and 4 to yellow.

This high-dimensional dataset can be difficult to work with and may require advanced techniques such as dimensionality reduction to be used effectively.\n",
